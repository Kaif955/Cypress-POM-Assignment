## all_test_call.js
The `all_test_call.js` file serves as the main test file that orchestrates the execution of all functionalities implemented in the Page Object Model (POM). This file includes the following:

- **Login Functionality**: Calls the login functions to authenticate users.
- **Product Search**: Utilizes product-related functions to search and validate products.
- **Cart Management**: Integrates cart operations to test adding, removing, and updating items.
- **Checkout Process**: Calls checkout functionalities to simulate the payment and order completion.

This centralized approach allows for streamlined testing of all functionalities in a cohesive manner, making it easier to maintain and extend tests.
